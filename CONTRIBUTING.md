## Reporting An Issue

If you're looking to raise an issue because think you've found a problem, or you'd like to make a request
for a new feature in the codebase, or any other reasonâ€¦ please read this first.

The GitHub issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[feature requests](#features), [change requests](#changes) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **search for existing issues**. Help us keep duplicate issues to a minimum by checking to see if someone
has already reported your problem or requested your idea.

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

4. **Include a screencast if relevant** - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? The most
helpful thing in the world is if we can *see* what you're talking about.
Use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your GitHub issue. Kapow.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Be sure to include the
details of your environment.

### Issue Summary

A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. This is the first step
2. This is the second step
3. Further steps, etc.

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
reported. Especially, why do you consider this to be a bug? What do you expect to happen instead?

### Technical details:

* Client OS: Mac OS X 10.10.1
* Server OS: CentOS 6.4
* Node Version: 0.10.16
* Browser: Chrome 39.0.2171.71

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are very welcome.

### Change Requests

Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how **chequeador** works. If you have an idea for a
new or different dependency, a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc - please be sure to:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check someone else didn't get there first

2. Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and explain what you're thinking as it's up to you to convince the project's leaders the change is worthwhile. Some questions to consider are:
    - Is it really one idea or is it many?
    - What problem are you solving?
    - Why is what you are suggesting better than what's already there?

### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are **awesome**. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#raising-issues) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged.
